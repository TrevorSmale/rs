## A collection of projects using the rust programming language

## Intro 🦀

In 2024 I began learning rust. My reason for doing so was to learn a low level language for embedded systems.
Although I had invested some time to C and C++, it became apparent that Rust was going to be a better choice as it offers better ergonomics and error handling. Furthermore, the use of hardware abstraction layers for embedded seems like an efficient approach that will reduce fragmentation and allow for faster prototyping.

Embedded hardware is not my main focus, so I work on these projects on occasion, spending most of that time on researching best practices. If you are interested in exploring this same stuff, I suggest 'The Embedded Rust Book' an easy to acquire book that suggests starting with an STM32Explorer board. Furthermore, I have found this YouTube Channel 'The Rusty Bits' https://www.youtube.com/@therustybits that covers many topics in detail.
